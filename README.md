# LinuxMassCdImager

## About
LinuxMassCdImager allows you to mass image cd/dvd's much faster then conventional methods
by auto ejecting the optical drive for you to put the disc in and then prompting you for the name of the iso and then imaging it automatically.

## Note
This was a quick script I made to help me image some discs, and is most likely full of bugs
